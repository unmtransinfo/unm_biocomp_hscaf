Designed for HierS scaffold analysis, for single molecules, datasets, or common-scaffold comparisons
between pairs or groups of molecules.
<!-- Description starts here. -->
<H3>Functionality</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Analyze a molecule and identify all scaffolds, linkers and side-chains, implementing
the HierS algorithm published by Wilkens et al. (see reference).
<LI> Scaffold attachment points can be identified.
<LI> Unique sets of scaffolds for a molecule or for a dataset of many molecules can be found.
<LI> The hierarchical scaffold tree for a molecule can be generated.
<LI> An N-attached variant of the HierS scaffold definition may be used, where atoms
single-bonded to ring nitrogens are considered part of the scaffold.
<LI> Maximum common scaffold of two molecules, maximum common subtrees of 
two scaffold trees.

hier_scaffolds - HierS scaffolds analyzer
usage: hier_scaffolds [options]
  required:
    -i IFILE
    -o OFILE ... one (possibly) disconnected mol of parts per input mol
  options:
    -out_scaf &lt;outscafs&gt; ... unique scafs numbered sequentially
    -inc_mol      ... include mols in output (-o)
    -inc_scaf ... include scaffolds in output (-o)
    -inc_link   ... include linkers in output (-o)
    -inc_chain ... include sidechains in output (-o)
    -scaflist_title  ... scaf/link/chain list written to title
    -scaflist_append2title  ... scaf/link/chain list appended to title
    -scaflist_sdtag &lt;sdtag&gt; ... scaf list written to SD dataitem
    -maxmol &lt;max&gt;   ... max size/atoms of input mol [default=100]
    -show_js         ... show junction points (as pseudoatoms) -- for debugging, visualizing
    -keep_nitro_attachments ... atoms single bonded to ring N remain in scaffold
    -v ... verbose
    -vv ... very verbose

<H3>Developer notes</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Classes Scaffold, Linker and Sidechain are super-classes of JChem's Molecule.
<LI> Mostly this implementation uses the MolBond.setSetSeq()/getSetSeq() methods
to tag and identify junction bonds, which join scaffolds, linkers and side-chains.
This approach is more elegant and efficient than tagging junctions via attached
atoms.
<LI> ChemAxon cxsmarts with smarts extensions used in this library.
We use MolAtom.PSEUDO with alias "J" (junction), matched by cxsmarts such as "[*].[*] |$J_p;J_p$|".
Note that MolAtom.PSEUDO=136, but w/ JChem [#136] does not match (bug?).  See
<A HREF="http://www.chemaxon.com/marvin/help/formats/cxsmiles-doc.html">cxsmiles-doc</A>.
One reason for this approach is that the wildcard atom MolAtom.ANY (comparable to
[#0] in Daylight, OEChem) cannot be readily matched with JChem and is, quite logically,
predominantly a query concept.
